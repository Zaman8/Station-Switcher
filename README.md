# Station-Switcher
A simple mobile game based on tuning a Radio. Each round gets harder, and continues until the player loses.

Each round the player can turn the dial one way, meaning if they past the desired station they lose; they also have a time limit each round,
which gets shorter each time. The player scores points for the number of rounds they lasted, and unlockable radios can be earned through
milestones.
