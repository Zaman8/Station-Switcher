#1 Create a New Branch for each new feature you are about to create/tweak
#2 The Master Branch should always be a playable working game
#3 To make pull requests @mention Zain or Tim to review it
#4 Never accept your own pull request
#5 To check out a branch post when you start and when you stop on #branch-checkout on Slack (don't want confusion over branch)
#6 When the Master is updated, update your branch from it (so it works when pulled back)
#7 Create Branches for Issues, to work on them
